In the world I come from it is, emphatically, <i>not okay.</i> We spend huge resources to make sure that files, scripts and apps built in version N work in version N+1 without modification. Even the smallest change in the core engine can break apps. It's just not acceptable. When we make changes we have to be sure there's no breakage. I don't know where these other people come from, or if they make software that anyone uses, but the users I know don't stand for that. As we expose the tradeoffs it becomes clear that <i>that's the issue here.</i> We are not in Year Zero. There are users. Breaking them is not an option. A conclusion to lift the confusion: Version 0.91 and 0.92 files are valid 2.0 files. This is where we started, what seems like years ago.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>BTW, you can ask anyone who's worked for me in a technical job to explain rules 1 and 1b. (I'll clue you in.

XML-RPC, SOAP, RSS, OPML. Each has been different from the others. In all this work, the most positive experience was XML-RPC, and not just because of the technical excellence of the people involved. In the end, what matters more to me is <a href=\\\"http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=collegiality\\\">collegiality</a>. Working together, person to person, for the sheer pleasure of it, is even more satisfying than a good technical result.

I also believe that if you have collegiality, technical excellence follows as a natural outcome.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>One more bit of philosophy. At my checkup earlier this week, one of the things my cardiologist asked was if I was experiencing any kind of intellectual dysfunction.

In an amazing bit of synchronicity, the next day John Robb <a href=\\\"http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/25.html#a2598\\\">located</a> an article in New Scientist that said that scientists had found a way to prevent this from happening. I hadn't talked with John about my experience or the question the doctor asked. Yesterday I was telling the story to my friend Dave Jacobs.
